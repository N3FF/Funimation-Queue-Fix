# Funimation-Queue-Fix
Chrome Extension: Funimation - Queue Fix

I'm no longer able to keep updating this and keeping it functional when things change on the site, so I am passing this on to others if they would like to continue it.

In the .JSON folder there is a JSON response to a queue query. This might help you if you are trying to understand their format. It's probably a little bit old now so the series information may have changed.

If you would like to edit things and load the extension locally, you can do so by going to the menu on the top right ( â‹® )-> More Tools -> Extensions. Then in the top right there is a switch to turn on "Developer Mode". This will allow you to load your own extensions. From there just select "Load Unpacked" and select the folder that this extension is in.
